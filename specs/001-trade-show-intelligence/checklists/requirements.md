# Specification Quality Checklist: Trade Show Intelligence Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

Key strengths:
- Three well-prioritized user stories with clear independent test criteria
- Comprehensive functional requirements (15 total) covering all aspects of the platform
- Technology-agnostic success criteria with specific, measurable outcomes
- Thorough edge case coverage including error handling and data quality scenarios
- Clear key entities that define the domain model without implementation details

The specification successfully balances business requirements with sufficient detail for planning, while avoiding premature technical decisions.
